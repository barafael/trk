# A hook script to call trk with the new branch name.
# This hook is invoked when a git checkout is run after having updated the worktree. The hook is given three parameters: the ref of the previous HEAD, the ref of the new HEAD (which may or may not have changed), and a flag indicating whether the checkout was a  branch checkout (changing branches, flag=1) or a file checkout (retrieving a file from the index, flag=0).

# This hook cannot affect the outcome of git checkout.

# To track branches with trk, it is recommended to do either of the following:
# * Copy this file to ./.git/hooks/post-checkout
# * Append the below lines to ./.git/hooks/post-checkout

trk branch $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
